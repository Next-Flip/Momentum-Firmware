### Breaking Changes:
- OFW: Battery: Rework gauge driver initialization routine (by @skotopes)
  - Reworks how communication with battery guage is done, improves reliability and fixes issues with battery percentage not showing
  - After installing firmware with this change, downgrading to old firmware will cause battery percentage to be blank
  - If you must downgrade firmware, use the [Guage Tool app](https://github.com/skotopes/flipperzero_gauge_tool) to unseal the guage
