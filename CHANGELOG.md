### Breaking Changes:
- OFW: Battery: Rework gauge driver initialization routine (by @skotopes)
  - Reworks how communication with battery guage is done, improves reliability and fixes issues with battery percentage not showing
  - After installing firmware with this change, downgrading to old firmware will cause battery percentage to be blank
  - If you must downgrade firmware, use the [Guage Tool app](https://github.com/skotopes/flipperzero_gauge_tool) to unseal the guage
- OFW: JS: Modules backport & overhaul (by @portasynthinca3), backport of backport (by @Willy-JL & @xMasterX)
  - OFW backported some modules we had, added lots of new stuff, and overhauled many other things
  - Non-exhaustive list of changes to help you fix your scripts:
    - `badusb`:
      - `setup()`: `mfr_name`, `prod_name`, `layout_path` parameters renamed to `mfrName`, `prodName`, `layoutPath`
      - effort required to update old scripts using badusb: very minimal
    - `dialog`:
      - removed, now replaced by `gui/dialog` and `gui/file_picker` (see below)
    - `event_loop`:
      - new module, allows timer functionality, callbacks and event-driven programming, used heavily alongside gpio and gui modules
    - `gpio`:
      - fully overhauled, now you `get()` pin instances and perform actions on them like `.init()`
      - now supports interrupts, callbacks and more cool things
      - effort required to update old scripts using gpio: moderate
    - `gui`:
      - new module, fully overhauled, replaces dialog, keyboard, submenu, textbox modules
      - higher barrier to entry than older modules (requires usage of `event_loop` and `gui.viewDispatcher`), but much more flexible, powerful and easier to extend
      - includes all previously available js gui functionality (except `widget`), and also adds `gui/loading` and `gui/empty_screen` views
      - existing scripts using gui in any way will need a huge amount of reworking
      - effort required to update old scripts using gui: extensive
    - `keyboard`:
      - removed, now replaced by `gui/text_input` and `gui/byte_input` (see above)
    - `storage`:
      - fully overhauled, now you `openFile()`s and perform actions on them like `.read()`
      - now supports many more operations including different open modes, directories and much more
      - `virtualInit()`, `virtualMount()`, `virtualQuit()` still work the same
      - effort required to update old scripts using storage: moderate
    - `submenu`:
      - removed, now replaced by `gui/submenu` (see above)
    - `textbox`:
      - removed, now replace by `gui/text_box` (see above)
    - `widget`:
      - only gui functionality not ported to new gui module, remains unchanged for now but likely to be ported later on
    - globals:
      - `__filepath` and `__dirpath` renamed to `__filename` and `__dirname` like in nodejs
      - `to_string()` renamed to `toString()`, now supports optional base parameter
      - `to_hex_string()` removed, now use `toString(num, 16)`
      - `parse_int()` renamed to `parseInt()`, now supports optional base parameter
      - `to_upper_case()` and `to_lower_case()` renamed and moved to string class as `"".toUpperCase()` and `"".toLowerCase()`
      - effort required to update old scripts using these: minimal
  - Added type definitions (typescript files for type checking in IDE, Flipper does not run typescript, and you code in javascript)
  - Documentation is incomplete and deprecated, from now on you should refer to type definitions (`applications/system/js_app/types`), those will always be correct
  - Type definitions for extra modules we have that OFW doesn't will come later
